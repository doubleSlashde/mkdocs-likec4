# Tutorial Project

This page demonstrates embedding views from the **Tutorial** LikeC4 project.

```` markdown title="LikeC4 Diagram"
``` likec4-view
index
```
````

<div class="result" markdown>

```likec4-view
index
```

</div>

!!! tip

    Note how we didn't need to specify the `project` parameter here, as the plugin automatically
    detected that we are within the `tutorial` project. Neat!
